                    What is a heap ? 
                </summary>
            <p>
            Heaps are used in many famous algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path,
            the heap sort sorting algorithm, implementing priority queues, and more. Essentially, heaps are the 
            data structure you want to use when you want to be able to access the maximum or minimum element very
            quickly.There are many variations of heaps, each offering advantages and tradeoffs.<br>

            <b>Definition</b><br>
            The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree 
            as shown in the figure below.Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is 
            completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point.

            In simpler terms a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property ie if P is a 
            parent of C, then the key(the value) of nope P is greater than the key of node C (Max Heap)

            Three are two types of heaps: <br>
            1) Max Heap <br>
            2) Min Heap <br>

            In the max heap the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the root node 
            is the one with the highest key value. Max heaps are generally used for implementation of Heap sort. 
            <br>
            In the case of min heap the keys of the parent nodes are always less than or equal to those of the children 
            and the lowest key is in the root node. Min heaps are generally used for implementation of priority queues.

            There are two general versions of the heap property: a min-heap property and a max-heap property.

            If A is an array representation of a heap, then in Max-heap: <br>
            A[parent[i]] > A[i] <br>
            which means that a node can't have a greater value than its parent. In a max-heap, the largest element
             is stored at the root, and the minimum elements are in the leaves.

            <p>
            Heapsort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. Like mergesort,
            heapsort has a running time of O(nlogn) and like insertion sort, heapsort sorts in-place so no extra
            space is needed during the sort. The binary heap data structure allows the heapsort algorithm to take
            advantage of the heap's heap properties and the heapsort algorithm makes use of the efficient running 
            time for inserting to and deleting from the heap.

                </p>

                <!--include python_anywhere.txt -->

                <p>
                    To run the example from the textbook, type:
                    <br/>
                    <code>
                        A
                        <br/>
                        # MAX or MIN
                        <br/>
                        build_heap(A, MAX)
                        <br/>
                        heapsort(A, MAX)
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can experiment with the algorithm by typing
                    in your own array (my_array = [x, y, z])
                    and running build_heap(my_array) or
                    heapsort(a_matrix, b_matrix).
