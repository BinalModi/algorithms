            <h2>
                What is a red-black tree?
            </h2>

                <p>
                    The colors (indeed, using any color at all -- we could call
                    them 0 and 1 trees!) are arbitrary. One story from one of
                    the creators is that they had red and black pens handy!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Red-black properties
                </h3>
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Every node is red or black.
                        <li>The root is black.
                        <li>Every leaf (<i>T.nil</i>) is black.
                        <li>If a node is red, then both of its children are
                            black. (Never two reds in a row while descending!)
                        <li>For each node, all paths from the node to its
                            descendant leaves contain the same number of black
                            nodes.
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        And so, a simple way to get an intuition as
                        to why no leaf is further than
                        twice as far from the root as the nearest leaf: The
                        nearest leaf is B levels from the root. Since there is
                        never more than one R-node between any two B-nodes, at
                        most, the furthest node can be 2B - 1 levels away from
                        the root.
                    </p>

                <h2>
                    Operations on red-black trees
                </h2>

                    <p>
                        <b>Remember:</b> This <i>is</i> a binary search tree.
                        <br>
                        So, non-modifying operations such as minimum(),
                        maximum(), successor(), predecessor(), and search() run
                        in O(height) time, and so for red-black trees, in O(lg
                        n) time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But what about insert and delete? They are obviously
                        trickier. In fact, they are the whole trick: the
                        red-black properties are just a way of keeping the tree
                        roughly balanced.
                    </p>
