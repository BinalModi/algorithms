            Greed Versus Dynamism: When Can We Make the Greedy Choice?
        </h1>
            <p>
            "Richard Bellman showed that a dynamic optimization problem in
            discrete time can be stated in a 
            recursive, step-by-step form known
            as backward induction by writing 
            down the relationship between the
            value function in one period and 
            the value function in the next
            period.”
            </p>

            <p>
            When a greedy algorithm can be (correctly) used,
            we don’t need to worry about the next period!
            We simply choose what is best for
            *this* period.
