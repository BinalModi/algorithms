            Greed Versus Dynamism: When Can We Make the Greedy Choice?
        </h1>
            <p>
            "Richard Bellman showed that a dynamic optimization problem in
            discrete time can be stated in a 
            recursive, step-by-step form known
            as backward induction by writing 
            down the relationship between the
            value function in one period and 
            the value function in the next
            period.”
            </p>

            <p>
            When a greedy algorithm can be (correctly) used,
            we don’t need to worry about the next period!
            We simply choose what is best for
            *this* period. This occurs when the entire opportunity cost for a
            choice is contained in the current period.
            </p>

            <p>
            On the other hand, when the opportunity cost spills over into other
            periods, we must resort to dynamic programming.
            </p>

            <p>
            Ferguson and Lim (2007) capture this idea in their distinction
            between static and dynamic consumption problems:
            </p>

            <blockquote> 
                In a static consumption problem the opportunity cost of
                spending an amount of money buy a unit of one commodity (and
                deriving the marginal utility associated with consuming one
                more unit of that commodity) is the largest extra utility would
                have derived from spending money some other on some other
                commodity. In a dynamic problem the opportunity cost of
                spending today is the largest extra lifetime utility we could
                have derived from saving the money and spending it at some
                point in the future.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                In their terms, when we have a static consumption problem
                (i.e., the opportunity cost is confined to the current period),
                we can use a greedy algorithm. When the opportunity cost must be
                considered over future periods, we must use dynamic
                programming.
